      I am Mamador Christian L.21 years old, and I live in Pola, Oriental Mindoro before and now I live in Molino VII, Bacoor Cavite. I have 1 sibling, and I am the older brother. I'm currently studying a bachelor of science in computer studies at plmun for my second year. I love playing basketball and also badminton.I can honestly claim that I have never in my life given my opinions any thought. I'm lacking experience because of growing up in a small town. I had not traveled to or been exposed to other locations, such as distant locales. I've always been held in these locations, and I spend every day with the same individuals.And now as a collage student I'm glad to be here at Pamantasan Ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa. And I'm hopping to have more new friends and have more knowledge about this subject " Human Computer Interaction". And that would be all Thank you!
